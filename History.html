		<h3 class="eventHeader" >History of Austin Texas</h3>
		<p>
			The state’s fourth largest city, Austin originated as the riverside village of Waterloo, in 
			a buffalo-hunting region occupied by Tonkawa and Comanche peoples. In 1839 it was selected by 
			scouts as the site for the permanent capital of the Republic of Texas and renamed to honor 
			Stephen F. Austin. By 1840 Austin was incorporated, with 856 residents. When Mexican invasion 
			threatened Texas in 1842, the government moved to Houston, but the town’s 
			citizens, determined to keep Austin the capital, staged the "Archive War", forcibly 
			retaining government records. The government returned to Austin in 1845, the year in which Texas 
			was admitted to the United States.
		</p>
		<p>
			The city flourished as a trading center for ranchers and farmers after the arrival of the Houston and Texas
			Central Railroad and the construction of a bridge across the Colorado River in 1871. A flood in 1900 caused destruction
			of the bridge. With the harnessing of the river for flood control and power in the early 1900's, industry began to develop.
			Austin Experienced dramatic growth during the 90's, fueled largely in part by high-ttech industries. This growth is still
			happening today, with Austin having the nation's fifth largest population increase over the past decade (2010 - 2019).
